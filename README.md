## [Dice Roll](https://github.com/samueldtodd/probability/blob/main/dice_roll.py)

You're offered the following bet: two dice will be rolled simultaneously, if neither die show a 5 or 6 you win. If either die shows 5 or 6, you lose. Should you take the bet? This Python script uses object-orientated programming to produce a die class which includes a method to simulate the rolling of dice. The user is first asked whether they take the bet and then asked to enter the number of simulations they wish to run. The game is then run for the desired number of simulations and the proportion of games in which the user won is returned. Different messages are printed based on whether or not the user took the bet. The user then has the option to view an explanation how the probability of winning can be calculated. While loops and try/exception are utilised to ensure user input is appropriate.
